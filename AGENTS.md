# Instructions for AI coding agents

You are helping a hackathon team build **Lease Loop**. The challenge is in `CHALLENGE.md`; the engineering rules in `RULES.md` are judged and must be followed. The short version:

- **No AI inside the product.** Never add an AI, ML or LLM SDK, model or API call to the app. All product logic is rules, data and algorithms. `npm run check:no-ai` enforces this.
- **Business logic goes in `src/domain/`** as pure functions: no I/O, no database, no `fetch`, no `Date.now()` / `new Date()` / `Math.random()`. Pass dates (ISO `YYYY-MM-DD`) and data in as arguments. Every function gets Vitest tests next to it, including edge cases.
- **Money is integer euro cents.** Never use floating-point euros for amounts. Round once, deliberately, and document the rule.
- **API routes** use `ok()` / `fail()` / `handleRoute()` from `src/server/api-response.ts`. Never return raw error messages or stack traces.
- **Every data change** goes through `withAudit()` in `src/server/audit.ts`. Use the `tx` it gives you for every write in that change.
- **Database changes:** edit `prisma/schema.prisma`, then run `npm run db:migrate`. Never hand-write migration SQL.
- **UI strings** go in `src/i18n/messages/{en,fi,sv,et}.json`, with the same keys in all four.
- **UI and UX:** read `UI_UX.md` for information hierarchy, readability and layout. It takes precedence over `DESIGN.md` on those decisions.
- **Files stay under 600 lines.** Split by responsibility.
- **Commits** use conventional messages: `type(scope): subject`. Never use `git commit --no-verify` or `git push --no-verify`. If a hook fails, fix the cause.
- Before saying a change is done, run `npm run check:all`; it's what CI runs.
- Read `data/DATA.md` before using the data pack. Schemas for every data file are in `src/data/schemas.ts`.

## Pull requests

- Before creating or updating a PR, read `.github/pull_request_template.md` and use
  its sections in order. This applies to every coding agent working in this repo.
- Use a short conventional title, `type(scope): summary`, with an issue/ticket ID
  when one exists. Describe the final diff, the customer impact and relevant trade-offs.
- Start with a short summary and link the primary issue and each relevant sub-issue,
  stating what the PR implements for each. Inspect existing issues before saying none
  are linked. Use `Closes #<number>` only for fully resolved issues, and `Refs #<number>`
  for partial work or related context; do not assume a parent closes its sub-issues.
- Fill every section with concrete information; use `N/A` with a reason rather than
  leaving prompts or dropping headings. Give reproducible reviewer steps and outcomes.
- Report only checks actually run. Identify failures and checks not run. Check boxes
  only for completed work; do not invent issue links, screenshots or test results.
- For UI changes, attach available visual evidence and report any visual review gaps.
- Use `.github/hackathon_submission.md` for the final judging PR and follow the
  submission title and deadline in `README.md`.

## This is NOT the Next.js you know

This version has breaking changes — APIs, conventions, and file structure may all differ from your training data. Read the relevant guide in `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` (resolved from this file's directory; in monorepos the `next` package may not be visible from the repo root) before writing any code. Heed deprecation notices.

This block is written and re-added by `next dev` — verify at `node_modules/next/dist/server/lib/generate-agent-files.js`. Removing it from a diff only re-creates the uncommitted change; committing it with your work keeps the tree clean.
